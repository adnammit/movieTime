## App Design

### Movies
A list of all movies in the collection. Filterable by:
* watched
* rating
* genre

### Movie entity
* movie data -- pulled from google api?
* watched flag
* rating
* category -- user assigned or pulled from data?

### User operations
* search for movies using api database
* add movies to collection
* add rating to a movie in the collection
* set watched flag for movies in collection
* set favorite flag for movies in collection


## TO DO
**start here**
* work out how these objects should be mapped:
    - Collection -> look into using data stored in api db
    - Movie -> CollectionItem?
    - SearchResult
        * SearchResult and CollectionItem inherit from some common base? they're v similar
    - consider making these interfaces
* consolidate css for movies and search
* well, apparently you can't write to a file in js, so you'll have to figure out how to store data...
* work flow: 
    - default: display all in own collection
    - click Favorites to filter favorites
    - click To Do to filter unwatched
    - unclicking Favorites/To Do displays all in collection
    - running a search either:
        * replaces collection with search results (swap Movies.vue for Results.vue?)
            - similar look to Movies but with a button to add the movie instead of watched/favorite flags
            - clicking a search result will open a modal w more details
        * show dropdown w basic info for each movie. 
            - hover shows details 
            - clicking adds the movie... idk
* add [uNoGS](https://rapidapi.com/unogs/api/unogs) to query whether or not a movie is available on netflix
* what is your data model here? what will be retrieved via api vs stored?
    - data that would need to be stored: check out `data.json`
* figure out how to store user selections
    - psql
    - json file
* add a store
    - replace movies w/ results when searching
    - pass around isLoading/isErrored maybe 
    - toggle favorites/unwatched views
* search function
    - display results in dropdown: whether they are in collection or not
    - on click
    - how to set error message (no results found)    
* nice stuff
    - add genres: 
        * mystery
    - do something with posters?
    - for a row, if click (hover?), display modal w/ poster and plot
    - add sort by genre
    - allow sort by name, year, rating, watched, favorited
* consolidate css into separate files if that makes sense
* wow yr build takes one million years... see if you can delete some unused packages

## DONE
* refactor to use a centralized request mgr for cleaner code -- let components just be components
* re-write to use vuetify instead of bootstrap
* nice stuff
    - how to represent genres? icons?
        horror - ghost
        scifi - death-star-variant
        action - car-sports, gun, run-fast 
        comedy - emoticon-lol, emoticon-lol-outline
        drama - drama
        romance - heart-multiple
        animation - draw
        western - cowboy, cactus
        documentary - video-vintage
* typescript yo -- do some processing on movies
    - go through script and make sure you don't have dupe functions
